###Static Site Generation using Hakyll/Haskell
####For the AmbitiousCity.com site

Hakyll is a static site generator using the Haskell language. It is similar to the Ruby-based Jekyll. 

My goal is to create an attractive website for Ambitious City that is static (that is, does not depend on the complexities of a back-end database), which is hosted on Github and also includes some basic Haskell data structures. 

My first project will be represent simple causal loops (like the ones you see in ecological models). I hope to model simple 'vicious and virtuous' circles.
